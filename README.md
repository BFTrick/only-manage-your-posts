## Description

A WordPress plugin that prevents users from see others' posts.

## Background

This plugin was originally written by [Allen Holman](http://code.mincus.com/41/manage-your-posts-only-in-wordpress/) and has since been abondoned(?? - I think). I've updated it but most of this plugin is his creation.
